                I am a dependable person who is great at time management. I am always energetic and eager to learn new skills. I have experience working as part of a team and individually. I am flexible in my working hours, being able to work evenings and weekends.I am honest and trustworthy when I am counting money. I motivate to other people to be a strong person.
